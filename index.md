The episodes in this lesson cover how to open, work with, and plot
vector and raster-format spatial data in R. Additional topics include
working with spatial metadata (extent and coordinate reference systems),
reprojecting spatial data, and working with raster time series data.

This lesson assumes you have some knowledge of `R.` If you've never
used `R` before or need a refresher, start with our
[Introduction to R](https://castanedam.github.io/DTRA_workshop_R/)
lesson.
